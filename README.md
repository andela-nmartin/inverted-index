Inverted-index

This is an object that takes a JSON array of text objects (from 'books.json') and creates an index from the array. The index allows a user to search for text blocks in the array that contain a specified collection of words.


Instructions to install, configure, and to run the programs

Because browsers have restrictions on referencing other files (cross-origin requests), it is necessary to run the tests on a local server. You can use npm install -g local-web-server.

The test scripts are added to SpecRunner.html, as well as the script to be tested. To view tests, start the server using the command ‘ws’ on terminal. Copy the localhost url to browser address bar. Select the SpecRunner.html to open.
